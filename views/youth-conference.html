                <h2>Multiple youth in your family attending?</h2>
                <p>The registration form only allows <u>one submission per email sign in</u>. So if you have multiple
                    youth attending youth
                    conference, you will need to sign in to one email account, submit the form and then sign out. Then,
                    sign back using a different email account for the next child. We realize that this is inconvenient,
                    but since google forms doesn't currently have a good way to submit a handwritten signature using a
                    signature pad, we have to create an electronic signature using unique email sign-ins for each
                    submission. Thanks for your patience!
