                <p>More than any other people on earth, we have, through the glorious events of the Restoration of the
                    gospel, felt gratitude for what God has revealed about Himself that we might trust Him.</p>

                <p>I feel that scripture has great significance for everyone in the Church, no matter what his calling
                    might be. Experience has taught me that the Lord does prepare the way if we are diligent and
                    faithful in doing our part.</p>

                <h2>Be Like Nephi <span>~Young Men General Presidency</span></h2>
                <p>Nephi was obedient because he had sought and received his own testimony of the Lord’s commandments to
                    his father. [He] knew that the Lord would be with him and prepare a way for them to
                    accomplish it.</p>
